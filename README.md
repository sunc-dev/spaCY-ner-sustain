# Introduction 
This repository provides test notebooks on training and testing a custom entity recognition model for detecting sustainability and resilience technologies within documents.
The model is built using SpaCy nlp library and their NER model.

# Getting started
The notebook repo contains two notebooks:
1.  Install jupyter lab.
2.	[ner-train-note](./ner-train-note.ipynb): test code to setup doc objects, define custom entity, and parse training data for the NER model.
3.	[ner-model-note](./ner-model-note.ipynb): test code to setup the NLP pipeline, NER model and apply training for our custom entity we defined.
4.	[ner-test-note](./ner-test-note.ipynb): run saved model on new data.
5.  In cmd navigate to root and type jupyter lab.
